# Azure Compliance Best Practices

## Overview
This document outlines essential compliance best practices for Azure Data Factory to Databricks implementations to ensure security, governance, and regulatory adherence.

## Data Governance

### Data Classification
- Implement Microsoft Purview for data discovery and classification
- Tag sensitive data with appropriate sensitivity labels
- Use Azure Policy to enforce data classification requirements
- Maintain data lineage tracking across Data Factory and Databricks

### Data Residency
- Configure Azure regions to meet data sovereignty requirements
- Use Azure Private Link for secure data transfer
- Implement geo-redundancy based on compliance needs
- Document data flow and storage locations

## Security and Access Control

### Identity and Access Management
- Implement Azure Active Directory integration
- Use managed identities for service-to-service authentication
- Apply principle of least privilege access
- Enable multi-factor authentication for all users

### Network Security
- Configure Virtual Network integration for Databricks
- Use private endpoints for Data Factory connections
- Implement network security groups and firewall rules
- Enable Azure DDoS Protection

### Encryption
- Enable encryption at rest for all data stores
- Use customer-managed keys when required
- Implement encryption in transit for all data transfers
- Maintain key rotation policies

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Activity Monitoring
- Enable Azure Monitor for comprehensive logging
- Configure Azure Sentinel for security monitoring
- Implement custom alerts for compliance violations
- Use Application Insights for performance monitoring

### Audit Logging
- Enable Azure Activity Log for all resources
- Configure diagnostic settings for detailed logging
- Implement log retention policies per compliance requirements
- Use Azure Log Analytics for centralized log management

## Data Protection

### Backup and Recovery
- Implement automated backup strategies
- Test disaster recovery procedures regularly
- Document recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO)
- Use Azure Backup for critical data protection

### Data Loss Prevention
- Implement Azure Information Protection
- Configure data loss prevention policies
- Monitor for unauthorized data access or transfer
- Establish incident response procedures

## Regulatory Compliance

### Framework Adherence
- Configure Azure Security Center compliance dashboard
- Implement controls for GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, or other relevant regulations
- Regular compliance assessments and reporting
- Maintain documentation for audit purposes

### Privacy Controls
- Implement data subject rights management
- Configure data retention and deletion policies
- Establish consent management processes
- Document personal data processing activities

## DevOps and Change Management

### Infrastructure as Code
- Use ARM templates or Terraform for reproducible deployments
- Implement version control for all infrastructure changes
- Establish approval workflows for production changes
- Maintain environment parity

### Continuous Compliance
- Integrate compliance checks into CI/CD pipelines
- Automate security scanning and vulnerability assessments
- Implement configuration drift detection
- Regular compliance validation testing

## Cost Management and Optimization

### Resource Governance
- Implement Azure Policy for resource compliance
- Use Azure Cost Management for budget tracking
- Apply resource tagging for cost allocation
- Regular resource utilization reviews

### Optimization Practices
- Right-size compute resources based on usage
- Implement auto-scaling for cost efficiency
- Use Azure Advisor recommendations
- Regular cost optimization assessments

## Documentation and Training

### Compliance Documentation
- Maintain up-to-date compliance policies
- Document all security controls and procedures
- Regular review and update of compliance documentation
- Establish change management processes

### Team Training
- Regular security and compliance training
- Azure certification programs for team members
- Incident response training and drills
- Stay updated with Azure compliance features
